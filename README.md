# textexpanders
textexpanders of various kinds some silly, some usefull, some mine, alot of them from Brett Terpstra and freinds some from I donâ€™t know where but thank you (especially the person who submitted latex ascii chars with / , that was brilliant!)

Some of these may no longer function as expected. 

Use at your own risk, free to whoever is interested.
